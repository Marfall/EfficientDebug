PLACE BREAKPOINTS AND RUN A PROGRAM IN DEBUG MODE:

        Debugging:

            - Is the process by which we can look for the issues in our code to detect them and find 
              a proper way to resolve them.


        Breakpoints (Line Brakepoints):


            - These are basically markers placed within the code in an editor where the program flaw(изъян)
              would be lost if the program run in debug-mode.


        - Right click on the code and click debug needed method  or class

        - The line will be marked as blue so the prigram is currently running in debug mode and the flow has paused at this line,
          and at the bottom we can see a few things:

            1) Variables Section:

            2) Debugger Window


        - What's happened here:

            - The program flow has paused means the line is not executed yet.

              => We can control the flow of the prigram in the Debug Window:


        - These are a few important buttons for debugging purpose:


            1) Step Over (F8):

                - Control would flow to the next line;


            2) Resime Program (F9):

                - Contol Flow will resume and it will pause at the Next Breakpoint.

                - Previous Line Breakpoint has been executed



CONTROL A PROGRAM EXECUTION DURING DEBUGGING:


        - In Debugging is very important  to control the flow of the Execution;

        - Step Over (F8):

            - Is operation by which we can proceed line by line while application debugging;
            - iIs used to nove the control line by line.

        - Step Into (F7):

            - If we want to go into this particular method;

              => Control has come inside the method. We can debug it line by line clicking step over and see what is
                 happening inside the method. 
                
            - Now we can see in the Variable Section what is the value of the input, what is the result, what is the input.length

        
        - Step Out (Shift + F8):

            - Move out from this particular method.



SMART STEP INTO AND RUN TO CURSOR:

      Smart Step Into:

        - During debugging there are scenarios where we have multiple method calls in a single line.

        - In scenarios like this, Smart Step Into becomes very useful.

        - Go to Run - Debugging Actions - Smart Step Into (Shift + F7),
          and it would higjlight different methods where you want to step in.

        - And you can choose nesessary method.

        - The Control has come to this method and it us returning the value of name  (in the method getName() for example).

        - So, from here we can continue te debuggin or we can return back using Step Out;

    
      Run to Cursor:

        - Suppose your proprm is running in Debug Mode. And you want to move the Control Flow to a particular line
          Without placing any breakpoints. 

        - In that case Move to Cursor is very useful.

        - Go to Run - Debugging Actions - Run To Cursor (Alt + Shift + 9)

        - So, you can see over here the Control has come to  line, where was the Cursor.


      Force Run To Cursor:

        - It would ignore any existing Breakpoints;

        - If you will do this with simple Run To Cursor - Control will be blocked in exeisting Breakpoint.



WATCH AND EVALUATE EXPRESSIONS:


    Wathches:

    - When a program is in Debug Mode and the Control Flow hits the Breakpoints, we can see the internal Variables 
      of that particular program within the Variable Section.

    - But there could be scenarios wehere we need to track more complex expressions, which are not the part of Code File itself.

    - How Watches can be added by default:

        - By default, the Watch Section is within the Variable Section - It's Glass Icon.

        - We can add or remove Warches by ckicking plus ion here.

        - We can also add one particular variable directly to the Watch Section by clicking on the top of that Variable,
          right click and then add to Watches.

        - Now, if we move with the Flow with Resume Button , we can see this Watch Expression being populated.

        - So, instead of only the person object what we can view - is different expressions, as we can se over here,
          this  person object has different arguments and they get the methods.

        - So, let me check  or all objects wheter the age of the person is greater than 30 or not. person.getAge() > 30

        - So, I type the Expression in the Watch Section and if we now move the Control of the Program,
          We can view for all objects the age is greater than 30 or not.


    Evaluate Expressions:

        - Evaluate Expressions allows us to evaluate any expressions during the program runtime.

        - We can click on that particular variable right click and then go to Evaluate Expression:

          - So, we can see over here - there is content assessed we can type any expression we want and click on Evaluate.

          - It would return the result over here.


        =>  -  Similary, any other expression can be evaluated here. 

            - Evaluated enables you to get the value of any expression - One Expression, whereas in case of Wathces the added
              Watch remains there for the entire program.



    =>  - So, if we want to evaluate one value at a time  Evaluate is good, but if we want to get the variables throughout 
          the program - say for a loop variables value would be getting repeated times then using Watches is an easier,
          and also in the Watches we can ad multiple Watches, so multiple expressions can be evaluated pretty easier.
